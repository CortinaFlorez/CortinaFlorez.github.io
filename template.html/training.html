	<p> Training your dog is not only going to make your life easier but dogs want to be trained and challenged in new ways.  Even when it comes to simple commands like sit, wait, lay down or drop it these are daily commands that will help you have better control and relationship with your dog.  Its almost the same thing as raising a young kid and making sure they know certain things so they stay safe.  If they are about to run across the street without you and you tell them to stop or wait it could save their lives and its the same with dogs.  Training your dog is a great way to build trust with your dog because they know you have their best interest at heart.  </p>

	<p> Aside from training your dog at home there are many other reasons why dogs get trained.  Many dogs are working dogs and are used as police dogs, seeing eye dogs, for medical reason, or even in the airport to sniff out bombs and drugs.  Dogs can be trained in so many different ways and it is so impressive to watch them do their job!
